What should our thesis be about? We're having a hard time coming up with something interesting, that we at the same time believe we can come to a conclusion about.

We've done some searching on google scholar about the following topics:

* SSR vs CSR
* Comparing rendering options in next.js
* Next.js prerendering strategies
* Load testing SSR vs CSR web applications
* Comparing loading strategies, loading spinner or skeleton, effect on user experience

* How Typescript impacts software code quality and developer experience

Should schools switch to teaching typescript instead of javascript?
Test out if typescript helps junior developers code? Autocomplete? Without knowing that they are programming in typescript (an object in another file thats in javascript vs typescript, how does the autocomplete of the object properties help the junior developer etc)?
