This is the start of our thesis project for the program **Webbprogrammerare** at Linneaus University Kalmar. My name is Samuel von Zweigbergk and my other group member is Ludwig Wittenberg. 

We are thinking of writing our thesis project about `Clean Architecture`, `Dependency Injection for testability` or `Performance of different web frameworks based on load testing`.
