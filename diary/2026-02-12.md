See how others have conducted their testing/methodology.
Did they do a 80/20 split of the datasets?

Use file-paths to datasets/images when testing the models, not a databse.
Not commit the datasets???

Decide on a detection-model to use.

Test all recognition models, most importantly `GhostFaceNet` and `DeepFace` (DeepFace framework's own model) as they have not been tested before.

Normalizing dataset structure to keep the same testing flow?
Folder per person/name, eg.

- brad-pitt
  - 001.jpg
  - 002.jpg
- will-smith
  - 001.jpg
  - 002.jpg

Can the amount of images per person in a dataset effect the accuracy and other results, ie. will it be more accurate if a person has 10 images vs 1?
