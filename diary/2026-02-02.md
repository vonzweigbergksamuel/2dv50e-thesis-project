Last thursday we got asked by a company that we are doing a project for in another course if we wanted to compare **Facial Recognition Models** and suggested it could be a good bachelor thesis. We though about it for a couple of days and have almost decided to switch to that, as it's still early in the course.

Because of that we have to write a new SPP quite quickly.
